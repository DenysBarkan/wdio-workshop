# WebdriverIO Workshop

Manually testing your website after every change is a pain, but setting up a test automation tool can be even worse. Instead of struggling through Java, what if you could just use JavaScript? WebdriverIO makes automated testing friendly by providing a NodeJS interface for Selenium-based testing.

This workshop will dive deep in to [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io), an open-source library used for Selenium testing. Weâ€™ll cover all the steps to get started writing automated browser tests.
