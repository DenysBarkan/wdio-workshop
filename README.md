# :star2: WebdriverIO Workshop :star2:

Manually testing your website after every change is a :boom: pain :boom:, but setting up a test automation tool can be even worse.

Instead of struggling through :coffee:Java:coffee:, what if you could just use :heartpulse:JavaScript:heartpulse:?

WebdriverIO makes automated testing friendly by providing a NodeJS interface for Selenium-based testing :100:

This workshop will dive deep in to [WebdriverIO](http://webdriver.io), an open-source library used for Selenium testing. Weâ€™ll cover all the steps to get started writing automated browser tests, including:

1. [Installation and Setup](./exercises/1-installation.md)
2. [Mocha, Chai and Assertions](./exercises/2-assertions.md)
3. [Common Commands](./exercises/3-commands.md)
4. [Utility Commands](./exercises/4-utilities.md)
5. [Pause and Debug](./exercises/5-debug.md)
6. [CICD Integration](./exercises/6-cicd.md)
7. [Next Steps](./exercises/7-next-steps.md)
